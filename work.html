          <br/>

          The goal of this project was to reimplement my previous
          implementation of a lambda calculus interpreter, which was
          written in Haskell, in C99 to make it cross-platform.

          <br/>

          I wanted to give flex and yacc a shot because I was hacking on
          Hugs98 and it used those tools. I have never used them before
          so that was a good reason to do something with'em.

          <br/>

          The project itself only depends on a C99 compiler, flex, yacc
          and make. For readline support I
          recommend `<a href="https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap">rlwrap</a>`,
          a little tool that adds support for readline in applications
          that don't support it.

          <br/>

          I deliberatly didn't add it as a dependency, since I wanted to
          have as few as possible and also, the GNU libs are usually a
          bit difficult to work with on foreign platforms.

          This is the original version of my lambda calculus interpreter
          in Haskell. I wrote it in an afternoon and had very much fun
          with it. Later I ported it to Hugs98 and it works in
          there. Switch to the hugs branch on GitLab to use the Hugs
          port.

          This little side project was just a little "farting
          around". Basically, I found this equation somewhere and
          wanted to solve it. So I researched a bit and coded this
          thing up. It only depends on a C99 compiler and
          gnuplot. Output is a png file, which you should see above.

          This was actually something I needed for Uni. Basically this
          is what this little program does: it calculates the minimum
          required amount of heat and cooling energy that has to be
          supplied in a network of heat exchangers inside a
          e.g. chemical plant to save on cost when running a
          process. It takes in the streams of liquids or gases and a
          minimum temperature difference. Based on this data, it spits
          out the optimal values for Q<sub>H</sub> and Q<sub>K</sub>,
          the minimum heating energy and the minimum cooling energy.
