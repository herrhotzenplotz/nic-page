        <h3>Commentary</h3>

        <br/>

        The goal of this project was to reimplement my previous
        implementation of a lambda calculus interpreter, which was
        written in Haskell, in C99 to make it cross-platform.

        <br/>

        I wanted to give flex and yacc a shot because I was hacking on
        Hugs98 and it used those tools. I have never used them before
        so that was a good reason to do something with'em.

        <br/>

        The project itself only depends on a C99 compiler, flex, yacc
        and make. For readline support I
        recommend `<a href="https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap">rlwrap</a>`,
        a little tool that adds support for readline in applications
        that don't support it.

        <br/>

        I deliberatly didn't add it as a dependency, since I wanted to
        have as few as possible and also, the GNU libs are usually a
        bit difficult to work with on foreign platforms.

        This is the original version of my lambda calculus interpreter
        in Haskell. I wrote it in an afternoon and had very much fun
        with it. Later I ported it to Hugs98 and it works in
        there. Switch to the hugs branch on GitLab to use the Hugs
        port.
