      <div class="question">
        Q: What do you do for a living?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        A: At the moment I am a student of process engineering.
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        Q: Operating system?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        A: I usually stream from a FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE box (hostname:
        triton). This is my day-to-day work machine and it has been
        really stable, so that's why I use FreeBSD. But I also have an
        Archlinux laptop (hostname: sagittarius). I use it as a mobile
        computer. I'd like to move it to BSD but hardware support is not
        perfect yet, so that's a no.

      <div class="question">
        Q: How old are you?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        A: I don't talk about that but what I can say at least, is that
        I was born in the 20th century :)
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        Q: Rust?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        A: I think Rust is an interesting language. The concept of it is
        not new, it has been explored in Haskell and other functional
        languages. Differences are, that Haskell is lazy, has a
        different and unusual syntax and uses other terminology than
        other procedural/imperative languages. People started to hype
        around Rust and from the past we know: the bigger the hype
        around a language, the faster it changes and the faster it
        dies. All in all: A big no, if I want memory-safety, I can use
        Haskell, it is a mature functional language. And if I wanna do
        low-level or imperative stuff, I can use C.

      <div class="question">
        Q: Where are you from?
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        A: Germany
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        Q: Text editor/IDE?
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        A: I don't use IDE's. For me, a plain editor is enough.<br/>

        In day-to-day life I use GNU/Emacs as my main editor and for
        quickly changing config files I usually use vi, joe or
        vim. Sometimes, if I need to paste some things from the
        clipboard into a file, I also use ed.
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        Q: Why not an IDE?
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        A: IDE's are usually increadibly huge bundles of software. I
        neither like to build these from sources nor download Gigabytes
        worth of precompiled binaries. Another point is, that when I
        write code, I start to have the design and naming convention of
        variables and function names in my head. By forcing yourself to
        not use an IDE which has got autocompletion and "IntelliSense",
        as M$ calls it, you enforce a consistent naming convention and
        coding style because you need a way to remember all these
        things. Furthermore, I like to think about how I want to design
        my software, which the current software development market
        discourages with it's rapid application development cycles.
        Using a plain text editor makes you think more carefully about
        what you do.
